# 🚀 Go (Golang) for DevOps – Learning Roadmap

Go (Golang) has become one of the most loved languages in **DevOps**.  
This roadmap takes you from **beginner → building real DevOps tools** step by step.

---

## 📌 Why Go for DevOps?
- Single binary builds → no dependency hell
- Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac)
- High performance & concurrency (goroutines)
- Ecosystem: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus… all built with Go!

---

# 🛠️ Roadmap

## 📍 Phase 1: Go Fundamentals (1–2 weeks)
**Goal:** Learn enough Go to write CLI tools and small automation scripts.  

**Topics:**
- Install Go + `go mod`
- Variables, functions, structs
- Error handling
- Concurrency basics (goroutines, channels)
- Work with JSON & YAML
- Build binaries with `go build`

**Mini-Projects:**
- CLI tool → print system info (`os`, `runtime`)
- Parse JSON config file
- Simple HTTP server → `Hello DevOps`

---

## 📍 Phase 2: DevOps-Oriented Projects (2–3 weeks)
**Goal:** Build tools that mimic DevOps workflows.  

**Learn:**
- CLI libraries (`cobra`, `urfave/cli`)
- File & process management
- HTTP requests (`net/http`)

**Projects:**
- Docker Log Exporter (tail container logs)
- Kubernetes Info CLI (fetch pod info with K8s client)
- System Monitor (collect CPU/memory stats + expose metrics for Prometheus)

---

## 📍 Phase 3: Infrastructure & Cloud Tools (3–4 weeks)
**Goal:** Work with IaC and cloud APIs.  

**Learn:**
- Go SDKs: AWS, GCP, Azure
- YAML/JSON templates (Terraform style)
- Plugins & providers

**Projects:**
- Mini Terraform Clone  
- Cloud Cost Estimator  

---

## 📍 Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability (2–3 weeks)
**Goal:** Build monitoring tools like Prometheus exporters.  

**Learn:**
- Prometheus Go client (`prometheus/client_golang`)
- Logging (`log`, `zap`, `logrus`)
- REST APIs with Go (`gorilla/mux`, `chi`)

**Projects:**
- Custom Prometheus Exporter (CPU/memory/disk stats)  
- Simple Log Aggregator (collect & expose logs via HTTP)  

---

## 📍 Phase 5: CI/CD & Automation (2–3 weeks)
**Goal:** Automate pipelines, create plugins, build agents.  

**Learn:**
- CI/CD runners (GitHub Actions, Drone CI)
- Webhooks & event-driven automation
- Git & Docker APIs

**Projects:**
- GitHub Webhook Listener  
- Mini CI Runner (accept job definition, run Docker containers)  
- Slack/Discord Bot (send deploy/build notifications)  

---

## 📍 Phase 6: Advanced & Real-World DevOps Tools (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Contribute to or build real-world tools.  

**Ideas:**
- Kubernetes Operator in Go  
- Service mesh-style proxy (with gRPC)  
- Contribute to **Terraform, Prometheus, Loki, Vault**  

---

# 📅 Suggested Timeline
- **Month 1** → Go basics + CLI tools  
- **Month 2** → Infra & monitoring tools  
- **Month 3** → CI/CD automation + Kubernetes operators  
- **Month 4+** → Contribute to open-source & real-world scale projects

## ✅ Next Step
Start with **Phase 1**:  
👉 Build your first Go CLI tool → print system info (OS, CPU, memory).  
After that, move into container/Kubernetes projects.
